<span>I challenged myself to sharpen and refresh my coding skills on a well-known free programming website - FreeCodeCamp. Through this, I aim to make coding a daily habit </span></b>
<span>My goal is to complete the all 6 courses of the Full Stack Developer Curriculum</span>

**Repository containing my solutions to FreeCodeCamp's 12 core curriculum courses.** Perfect for reference, collaboration, or learning together!

FreeCodeCamp's Full Stack Developer Curriculum consists of 6 courses and each course usually takes up to 300 hours to complete: 
1. Responsive Web Design Certification (Completed)
2. JavaScript (Still doing)
3. Front End Development Libraries Certification
4. Phyton Certification
5. Relational Databases Certification
6. Back End Development and APIs Certification

Each course has 5 projects with a final Certification exam and after completing all these 5 courses, there is a final separate exam called "Certified Full Stack Developer Exam".
